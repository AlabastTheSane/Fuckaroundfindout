# **Welcome to Apostim! The unofficial guide for adding OStim to your favorite modlist, Apostasy!!!**

Have you ever thought to yourself, "Man, Aljo makes a great list, but it's missing some *spice*"? No? Good, you're a sane person, and not someone who should be reading this guide! Be on your way.
All that to say, the ultimate (read, bare minimum) guide to adding OStim to Apostasy has arrived!

## What you will need!
- A working copy of Apostasy (For very obvious reasons)
- The ability to read (again, quite obvious)
- A desire to live as degenerate of a life as possible

## Getting started

**YOU MUST ENSURE THAT THE NEVERNUDE OPTION IS TOGGLED OFF IN MO2 UNDER THE LIST CUSTOMIZATION SETTING**

First, you'll need to navigate to nexus, and download [OStim Standalone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98163). Download it, install it, and place it **ABOVE** the Dyndolod plugins.
Once that is installed and activated, head back to nexus, because now you get to *immerse* yourself in finding animation packs! I recommend [Anubs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101918), [BakaFactory's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106473), [Billy's Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/102778), [More Billy's Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101838), [Even MORE Billy's Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99907), and [One last Billy's Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98803). Once those are all downlaoded, follow the same proccess as OStim standalone, and 
Now, onto actually being able to utilize the framework, not just having the animations available. You'll want to grab [OStim on Demand](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103685), [OStim Lovers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90053), [ORomance](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81635), and [OCum Ascended](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77506) This last one is entirely optional, and can be used or not used at your discretion.

## Follow Up!

You've got all of these degenerate mods downloaded, installed, and palced above Dyndolod.esp on the right hand side. Now what? Well, now you get to run Nemesis!!!! So navigate to the dorp down in MO2, where it says Play, and select the Nemesis Unlimited Behavior option. Press Run. You will want to press Update Engine to ensure that it is reading the proper mods location. Once thats done, and it says engine update compelte, ensure that the following mods are checked in the upper box:
Attack - Distar Experience
Asrak's werewolf attack speed resource
Maxsu Block Overhaul
Precision
Precision Creatures
Dragon Attack Speed Fix
Extra Drawing Animations
EVE Ghostly Instruments Fix
Payload Interpreter
GP Offset Movement Animation
Horse Riding Improvements
(zxlice's ultimate potion animation)
Unclench
Proper Spell Cast Diration
Retimed Hit Frame
SCAR
Modern Stagger Lock
True Directional Movement - 360 Horse Archery
True Directional Movement - Procedural Leaning
True Directional Movement - Headtracking
TK Dodge RE / Ultimate Combat
Animation Teleport Bug Fix
(Weapon Switch Animation Fix - Behavior Patch Version)

Once you've made sure those are selected, you can hit run, and it will proccess the animations (including the degenerate ones you've added!). Let the program run to completion, and when its done, close the program. Reset the MO2 drop down back to Play, and than start a new game. If you've followed the steps outlined above properly, than your new degenerate MCMs should have laoded, and you can configure them how you so desire!

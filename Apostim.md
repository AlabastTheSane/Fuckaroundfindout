# **Welcome to Apostim! The unofficial guide for adding OStim to your favorite modlist, Apostasy!!!**

Have you ever thought to yourself, "Man, aljo makes a great list, but it's missing some *spice*"? No? Good, you're a sane person, and not someone who should be reading this guide! Be on your way.
All that to say, the ultimate (read, bare minimum) guide to adding OStim to Apostasy has arrived!

## What you will need!
- A working copy of Apostasy (For very obvious reasons)
- The ability to read (again, quite obvious)
- A desire to live as degenerate of a life as possible

## Getting started

**YOU MUST ENSURE THAT THE NEVERNUDE OPTION IS TOGGLED OFF IN MO2 UNDER THE LIST CUSTOMIZATION SETTING**

So, you've decided to make Apostasy a little bit degenerate? There is a step you should take to maintain your sanity before you can begin the proccess. 
1) Make a new profile in MO2. This can be done via the profile dropdown window in the top of MO2. Name it whatever you wish, and it will copy all of the current load order settings, and plugin order that default Apostasy contains. ![ProfileDropdown](https://github.com/AlabastTheSane/Fuckaroundfindout/blob/main/Skyrim%20Special%20Edition%20–%20Mod%20Organizer%20v2.5.1rc2-ML1.2%20(AlabastTheSane_)%208_26_2024%2012_41_21%20AM.png)

After you've made your new profile, you'll need to navigate to nexus, and download [OStim Standalone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98163). Download it, install it, and place it **ABOVE** `DynDOLOD.esp` and `Occlusion.esp`.  
Once that is installed and activated, head back to nexus, because now you get to *immerse* yourself in finding animation packs! I recommend [Anubs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101918), [BakaFactory's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106473), [Billy's Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/102778), [More Billy's Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101838), [Even MORE Billy's Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99907), and [One last Billy's Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98803). Once those are all downlaoded, follow the same proccess as OStim standalone, moving any plugins above `DynDOLOD.esp` and `Occlusion.esp`.  
Now, onto actually being able to utilize the framework, not just having the animations available. You'll want to grab [OStim on Demand](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103685), [OStim Lovers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90053), [ORomance](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81635), and [OCum Ascended](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77506). This last one is entirely optional, and can be used or not used at your discretion.

## Follow Up!

You've got all of these degenerate mods downloaded, installed, and palced above Dyndolod.esp on the right hand side. Now what? Well, now you get to run Nemesis!!!! So navigate to the dorp down in MO2, where it says Play, and select the Nemesis Unlimited Behavior option. ![NemesisRuns](https://github.com/AlabastTheSane/Fuckaroundfindout/blob/main/Skyrim%20Special%20Edition%20–%20Mod%20Organizer%20v2.5.1rc2-ML1.2%20(AlabastTheSane_)%208_26_2024%2012_43_58%20AM.png) Press Run. You will want to press Update Engine to ensure that it is reading the proper mods location. Once thats done, and it says engine update compelte, ensure that the following mods are checked in the upper box:

Attack - Distar Experience  
Asrak's werewolf attack speed resource  
Maxsu Block Overhaul  
Precision  
Precision Creatures  
Dragon Attack Speed Fix  
Extra Drawing Animations  
EVE Ghostly Instruments Fix  
Payload Interpreter  
GP Offset Movement Animation  
Horse Riding Improvements  
zxlice's ultimate potion animation  
Unclench  
Proper Spell Cast Diration  
Retimed Hit Frame  
SCAR  
Modern Stagger Lock  
True Directional Movement - 360 Horse Archery  
True Directional Movement - Procedural Leaning  
True Directional Movement - Headtracking  
TK Dodge RE / Ultimate Combat  
Animation Teleport Bug Fix  
Weapon Switch Animation Fix - Behavior Patch Version  

Once you've made sure those are selected, you can hit run, and it will proccess the animations (including the degenerate ones you've added!). Let the program run to completion, and when its done, close the program. Reset the MO2 drop down back to Play, and than start a new game. If you've followed the steps outlined above properly, than your new degenerate MCMs should have loaded, and you can configure them how you so desire! 
### Something to note, if you wish to have SMP active in scenes, you will need to navigate to the Apostasy MCM Hider, and Unhide the 3BA MCM. YOu can modify the SMP/CBPC toggle through this MCM.

# GO FORTH AND BE A DEGENERATE IN THE WONDERFUL WORLD THAT ALJO HAS CREATED!!!
